# BASIC SCRIPTING

A shell script is a file containing a series of commands that are executed in sequence by the shell interpreter. It is a file of executable commands that has been stored in a text file. When the file is run, each command is executed. Shell scripts are written in scripting languages supported by the shell, such as Bash, sh, or zsh.

Bash shell scripting involves writing scripts in the Bash (Bourne Again Shell) language, which is a command-line interpreter widely used on Unix-like operating systems.

Bash aliases are a feature that allows a user to create a shortcut or alternative name for a command. It provides a convenient way to create shortcuts or alternative names for frequently used commands.

To create an alias, use the `alias` command followed by the alias name and the command it represents. For example:

- `alias c="clear"`: This alias makes c a shortcut for the clear command.
- To make aliases permanent, add them to your shell's configuration file, such as `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`. Open the file in a text editor and add your aliases there. After saving the file, either restart your terminal or run source `~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.
